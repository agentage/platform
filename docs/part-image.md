# Run a part image

A part image is the container image `build` makes for one part. A deployment sets these values
when it runs the image. The audience (`AGENTAGE_AUDIENCE`) is the set of hosts a token is valid for.

| Setting                                                   | Meaning                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Entry                                                     | `node node_modules/@agentage/extension/dist/runtime/main.js <part>`; port `3000` (`PORT` overrides)                          |
| `/health`                                                 | loopback only (the container `HEALTHCHECK`, an operator on the node); `404` from any other address                           |
| `/.well-known/agentage-extension.json`                    | the record at `/run/agentage/agentage-extension.json` (`AGENTAGE_RECORD_FILE`) plus the host                                 |
| `AGENTAGE_ORIGIN`                                         | the deployment's origin; pages and ui take it from the request without it                                                    |
| `AGENTAGE_SETTINGS`                                       | JSON of setting values over the manifest defaults                                                                            |
| `AGENTAGE_STORE_URL` / `_FILE`                            | the postgres connection (or a file holding it); else libpq `PG*` variables                                                   |
| `AGENTAGE_ISSUER`, `AGENTAGE_AUDIENCE`, `AGENTAGE_ORIGIN` | required for api and mcp. Without them the part does not start. It also does not start when its host is not in the audience. |
| `AGENTAGE_ISSUER`, `AGENTAGE_AUDIENCE` on pages           | CSP script-src, connect-src add these hosts; helmet's style-src keeps 'unsafe-inline'                                        |
| `AGENTAGE_TELEMETRY_URL`                                  | `ctx.platform.telemetry` (with `issuer`, `audience`; a value a part lacks is `''`)                                           |
| `AGENTAGE_DEV_ISSUER`                                     | set by `up` for the ui part only: its CSP then lets the harness reach the dev issuer                                         |
| `Cookie` request header                                   | dropped before any handler; a part sets no cookie and its CORS carries no credentials                                        |

JSON Schemas for the manifest, the build record, the discovery document, `/health` and the
envelope are in [`packages/extension/schemas`](../packages/extension/schemas). Regenerate them with
`npm run build && npm run schemas`.
